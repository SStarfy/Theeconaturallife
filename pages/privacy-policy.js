      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> September&nbsp;20,&nbsp;2025</p>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        EcoNaturalLife (referred to as “we,” “us,” or “our”) operates this
        website to provide information about and sell eco‑friendly products.
        Protecting the privacy of our visitors is important to us. This
        Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use and
        share it, and the choices you have. By accessing or using our website,
        you agree to the terms described here.
      </p>
      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide when you
        interact with our site—for example, when you sign up for a newsletter,
        place an order, or contact us. This may include your name, email
        address, billing and shipping addresses, payment information, and any
        other details you choose to share. We also automatically collect
        certain information through cookies and similar technologies, such as
        your IP address, browser type and version, and information about your
        interactions with our site. A privacy policy should describe the
        categories of information collected and why they are collected【672358383428450†L284-L296】.
      </p>
      <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
      <p>
        We use the information we collect to operate and improve our
        website, fulfil orders, communicate with you, provide customer
        support and marketing, comply with legal obligations, and protect our
        rights. We may aggregate or anonymize data for analytics and
        research purposes. It is good practice to clearly explain all the
        ways in which your site collects, uses, and discloses personal data【672358383428450†L298-L304】.
      </p>
      <h2>Sharing and Third‑Party Access</h2>
      <p>
        We share personal information with trusted service providers to help us
        operate this website and deliver our products—such as payment
        processors, shipping partners, analytics and advertising providers, and
        email marketing platforms. These third parties are authorized to use
        your information only as necessary to perform services on our
        behalf. We do not sell your personal information. According to
        guidance, privacy policies should spell out what data is shared with
        other businesses and note that third parties may have their own
        privacy policies【672358383428450†L306-L313】.
      </p>
      <h2>International Data Transfers</h2>
      <p>
        Because we use service providers located in other countries, your
        information may be transferred and stored outside your state, province
        or country. When we transfer personal data internationally, we
        implement safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses or other
        approved mechanisms to help ensure the protection of your data【672358383428450†L315-L330】.
      </p>
      <h2>Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        We and our third‑party partners use cookies and similar tracking
        technologies to remember your preferences, analyze site traffic, and
        deliver relevant advertising. You can control cookie settings through
        your browser; however, disabling cookies may affect the functionality
        of the site. This section explains the types of tracking
        technologies you use and may link to a detailed cookie list【672358383428450†L332-L338】.
      </p>
      <h2>Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain personal information only as long as necessary to fulfill
        the purposes described in this policy, comply with our legal
        obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. The policy
        should describe how long identifiable information is kept before it
        is deleted【672358383428450†L340-L344】.
      </p>
      <h2>How We Protect Your Data</h2>
      <p>
        We implement administrative, technical and physical security measures
        designed to protect your personal information against unauthorized
        access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. These measures include
        encryption of data in transit, secure servers, and access controls.
        Despite these efforts, we cannot guarantee absolute security【672358383428450†L345-L349】.
      </p>
      <h2>Your Rights</h2>
      <p>
        Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to access,
        correct, update, or delete your personal information; to object to or
        restrict our processing of your data; and to request data
        portability. California residents may have additional rights under the
        California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and California Privacy Rights
        Act (CPRA), including the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of
        personal information. We honor all applicable rights requests and
        limitations【672358383428450†L352-L356】.
      </p>
      <h2>Opt‑Out and Preferences</h2>
      <p>
        You may opt out of receiving marketing emails by following the
        unsubscribe instructions in those emails. You can also adjust your
        browser settings to reject cookies or opt out of targeted advertising
        through industry tools. The policy should describe how people can
        opt out of having their data collected【672358383428450†L359-L363】.
      </p>
