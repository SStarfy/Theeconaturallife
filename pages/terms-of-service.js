      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the EcoNaturalLife website and services (collectively, the “Service”). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, you may not use the Service. The introduction clause should outline who and what the agreement applies to and tell users how they can express consent to the agreement.</p>
      <h2>2. Acceptable Use</h2>
      <p>You agree to use the Service only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. Prohibited behaviors include breaking the law; posting violent, obscene or misleading content; stalking or harassing others; violating copyright; tampering or hacking into the site; spamming; or scamming users. We reserve the right to take appropriate action, including terminating access, for violations of this section.</p>
      <h2>3. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>The Service and its content—including designs, text, graphics, images, logos and trademarks—are owned by EcoNaturalLife or our licensors and are protected by intellectual property laws. We grant you a limited, non‑exclusive, non‑transferable license to access and use the Service for personal, non‑commercial purposes. You may not reproduce, modify, distribute, or create derivative works from any content without our prior written permission.</p>
      <h2>4. Product Information and Pricing</h2>
      <p>We strive to provide accurate product descriptions and pricing but do not guarantee that all information is current or error‑free. We reserve the right to correct errors, change prices or discontinue products without notice.</p>
      <h2>5. Payments</h2>
      <p>Payments for products purchased through the Service are processed by third‑party payment providers. You agree to provide current, complete and accurate purchase and account information. Your payment method may be charged in advance or at the time of shipment. If payment is not successful or is revoked, we may cancel your order.</p>
      <h2>6. User Content</h2>
      <p>If you post reviews, comments or other content to the Service, you retain ownership of your content but grant us a non‑exclusive, worldwide, royalty‑free license to use, reproduce and display it in connection with the Service. You represent that you have the rights necessary to post your content and that it does not violate the rights of others.</p>
      <h2>7. Termination</h2>
      <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the Service at our sole discretion, with or without notice, if we believe you have violated these Terms or applicable law. You may discontinue using the Service at any time.</p>
      <h2>8. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>The Service is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis without warranties of any kind. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. We do not guarantee that the Service will be uninterrupted or error‑free. You agree that our total liability to you for any claims arising from your use of the Service will not exceed the amount you paid, if any, for products purchased through the Service.</p>
      <h2>9. Third‑Party Links</h2>
      <p>The Service may contain links to external websites that are not controlled by us. We are not responsible for the content or practices of any third‑party sites and encourage you to review the terms and privacy policies of those sites.</p>
      <h2>10. Modifications</h2>
      <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Changes will be effective upon posting on this page unless otherwise specified. By continuing to use the Service after any changes, you accept the updated Terms.</p>
      <h2>11. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any disputes arising under these Terms will be resolved through binding arbitration in San Francisco County, California, except that either party may seek relief in a court of competent jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable relief.</p>
